# FLOW FARM DESIGN BIBLE
Last updated: 2026-04-23

This is the living source of truth for all design decisions, copy rules, aesthetic standards, and implementation notes for the Flow Farm landing page (FlowFarmLanding2.jsx / flowfarmforest.com) AND the Garran Hill landing page (GarranHillV2 / garren-hill.pages.dev).

---

## DEPLOYMENT LAW -- NON-NEGOTIABLE

### Base44 is DEAD for landing pages. It does not exist.

The ONLY valid deployment pipeline for both properties is:
1. Edit master JSX locally (`/app/.agents/FlowFarmLanding2_MASTER.jsx` or `/app/.agents/GarranHillV6_MASTER.jsx`)
2. Build standalone HTML (run build script)
3. Push directly to GitHub
4. Cloudflare Pages deploys automatically

**NEVER use `manage_app` publish for landing pages.**
**NEVER use the Base44 editor for landing pages.**
**NEVER show Rachel a Base44 preview URL for landing pages.**

The live URLs are:
- Flow Farm: https://flowfarmforest.com (Cloudflare)
- Garran Hill: https://garren-hill.pages.dev (Cloudflare)

GitHub repos:
- Flow Farm: rachelhernandezrealtor-a11y/flowfarm-landing
- Garran Hill: rachelhernandezrealtor-a11y/garren-hill

---

## THE MASTER TEMPLATE LAW

Both properties share ONE template. The architecture is identical. Only images, copy, and typography expression change per property. This is non-negotiable.

### What is LOCKED across both sites
- Section order logic (Hero > Manifesto/Story > CinematicReveals > PullQuotes > Stats > Inquire > Footer)
- Component architecture: CinematicReveal, PullQuote, FadeIn, stats bar, nav, inquiry modal
- Deployment pipeline: GitHub -> Cloudflare Pages
- CDN enhancement profiles: cdnInt / cdnExt / cdnForest
- Verification script before every push
- Color palette: DARK, GOLD, CREAM (same hex values on both)
- Build safety rules (no non-ASCII, no curly quotes, etc.)

### What CHANGES per property
- Typography expression (see per-property rules below)
- Hero photo / video
- All images
- All copy and headlines
- Accent copy moments (FF: smart home / GH: history)
- Stats bar values

---

## PER-PROPERTY TYPOGRAPHY RULES

### Flow Farm
- Primary display: `Georgia, serif`
- Stats/numbers: `'Cormorant Garamond', Georgia, serif` weight 300
- Vibe: working farm meets Aman resort. Warm, grounded, modern luxury.
- Headlines: mixed upright + italic, left-aligned on hero

### Garran Hill
- Primary display: `'Cormorant Garamond', Georgia, serif` -- Cormorant IS the primary face
- Body: Georgia, serif
- Stats/numbers: `'Cormorant Garamond', Georgia, serif` weight 300
- Vibe: 18th century Georgian formality. Older, grander, more restrained.
- Headlines: centered on hero, mixed upright + italic, declarative
- Eyebrows: same sans-serif, same gold, same spacing -- identical to FF

---

## BRAND IDENTITY

### Color Palette (BOTH PROPERTIES -- DO NOT CHANGE)
- DARK: `#0a0a0a` -- near-black background
- GOLD: `#C9A96E` -- accent, eyebrows, dividers, CTA
- CREAM: `#F5F0E8` -- body text on dark backgrounds
- WHITE: `#ffffff` -- headlines, pull quotes
- GLASS: `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)` -- frosted card fill
- GLASS BORDER: `rgba(255,255,255,0.28)` -- frosted card border

### Vibe
- Editorial. Aman resort aesthetic as the north star.
- NOT dark and moody. Vibrant, crystal clear, floating on glass.
- Full-bleed imagery. Minimal UI chrome.
- Let the property speak. Copy is spare and deliberate.
- Words float directly on images -- NO glass cards behind text.

## COPY RULES (BOTH PROPERTIES)

### Universal Voice Laws
- Declarative sentences. No hedging.
- Present tense. The property exists NOW.
- Specificity over adjectives. "17 feet tall" not "soaring ceilings."
- No real estate cliches: no "nestled," "boasts," "charming," "stunning."
- Short paragraphs. Two sentences max in body slots.
- Numbers are features. Lead with them.

### Flow Farm Copy Moments (LOCKED)
| Location | Line |
|---|---|
| Foyer | "one tap, the house shifts" |
| Living Room | "sound that fills seventeen feet without effort" |
| Kitchen | "music from speakers you can't see" + water filtration |
| Spa Bath | "lights already at ten percent" -- full-bleed pull quote |
| Closet | quiet one-liner about the dimmer |
| Office | solar/geo/generator handoff woven in |
| Exterior Night | "143 lighting circuits. Some of them are these trees." |
| Infrastructure | Lead with "the electrical capacity of a small hotel" |

### Garran Hill Copy Moments (LOCKED)
| Location | Line |
|---|---|
| Manifesto | Walter Hines Page / WWI / "never walked through the door" |
| Architecture | "Built by Leonard Tufts' own craftsmen -- the same men who built Pinehurst." |
| History | Betty Dumaine -- peacocks, Blue Fox grave, royalty |
| Westminster Abbey | "The friend of Britain in her sorest need." -- MUST appear |
| Ending | Ann's quote + "Garran Hill is ready." -- full stop, no pitch after |

### Garran Hill Copy Laws
- Do NOT name current owners -- "the current stewards" only
- "That someone is you" -- REMOVED, too salesy
- Authoritative, restrained tone throughout
- History is proof, not content -- every detail makes buyer feel chosen
- Lead with the ESTATE -- architecture first, history as backdrop

### Pull Quote Format (BOTH PROPERTIES)
- Full-bleed dark or image section
- Georgia italic, large centered text
- ASCII quotes only: `"` -- no curly quotes in code
- No attribution unless it adds authority

### Flow Farm Approved Headlines (LOCKED)
- Hero: "Agritourism Established. Legacy Ready."
- Quote section: "Autonomy at this scale is not inherited. It is engineered."
- Land section: "Three acres producing. Seven acres waiting."
- Mechanism section: "Structure that holds freedom."

### Garran Hill Approved Headlines (LOCKED)
- Hero: "Built in 1916. Still the finest house in Moore County."
- Hero subhead: "Neo-Georgian. Walter Hines Page. 110 years of remarkable stewardship."
- Manifesto: "Some houses hold history. This one shaped it."

## ANIMATION + INTERACTION RULES (BOTH PROPERTIES)

### Stats Bar
- Cormorant Garamond weight 300
- Gradient dividers (not hard lines)
- Frosted glass backing
- Two-line labels allowed for GH

### Parallax
- All full-bleed sections: backgroundPositionY scroll shift
- Shift: 0.18--0.25 multiplier (subtle)
- Ken Burns: scale 1.08 base

### Transitions
- No hard cuts between sections
- Dark bg sections bleed into each other
- Image sections: slight top/bottom gradient fade for legibility

### Lightbox (video -- FF only)
- Natural 16:9 ratio -- no cover cropping
- Scroll position saved on open, restored exactly on close
- Mobile portrait: letterbox with gold rotate nudge (fades 3s)
- Landscape mobile / desktop: full cinematic box

---

## TECHNICAL RULES (BOTH PROPERTIES)

### Build Safety
- NO non-ASCII characters -- will crash build silently
- Use `--` not em-dash in strings
- ASCII quotes only -- no curly quotes in code
- Check `ord(c) > 127` after every Python file manipulation
- SPELLING LAW: The property is always **Garran Hill** -- this IS the correct original 1913 spelling. Never "Garren Hill". Check every file.

### File Management
- Flow Farm source: `/app/.agents/FlowFarmLanding2_MASTER.jsx`
- Garran Hill source: `/app/.agents/GarranHillV6_MASTER.jsx`
- FF live: push via flowfarm push script to GitHub -> Cloudflare
- GH live: build standalone HTML, push to garren-hill GitHub -> Cloudflare
- Update master backup after EVERY approved change
- NEVER touch Base44 publish for landing pages

### Verification Before Every Push
- Check non-ASCII (must be zero)
- Confirm hero image/video URL is correct
- Confirm locked headlines are present
- Push to GitHub only -- Cloudflare handles the rest

---

## VIDEO RULES -- LAW, NON-NEGOTIABLE

### Platform
- ALL videos MUST be hosted on Cloudflare Stream. No exceptions.
- NO Vimeo. NO Base44 hosting. NO third-party video players.

### Flow Farm Locked Video URLs (DO NOT CHANGE)
| Video | URL |

### Garran Hill Video
- PENDING -- Rachel to upload to Cloudflare Stream when ready
- Will be a lightbox tour triggered by "Tour the Estate" button

## AI COPY VOICE -- THE PHILOSOPHY (LOCKED 2026-04-23)

We are smart. We are confident. Less is more.
But when we land a line -- it lands hard.

### The Core Truth
You are not describing a room. You are making someone feel something they cannot explain.
Smart buyers do not need to be told what to feel. Give them one fact, one image, one truth -- and get out.

### Copy Laws
- One sentence. Maybe two. Never three.
- Declarative. Present tense. No hedging.
- Specificity is everything. Numbers, materials, names. Not adjectives.
- Emotion comes from precision -- not from feeling words.
- Silence is a tool. Say less than you could. Always.

### Banned Words (GPT-4o enforces this list)
nestled, boasts, charming, stunning, exudes, inviting, timeless, seamlessly,
sophisticated, elegant, warmth, cozy, spacious, beautiful, gorgeous, luxurious,
features, offers, provides, showcases, highlights, impressive, remarkable

### Lines That Land (our north stars)
- "Seven fireplaces. This is the one that matters."
- "One tap. The house shifts."
- "Built 1916. Still the finest house in Moore County."
- "Heart pine floors. Seventeen feet to the peak."
- "143 lighting circuits. Some of them are these trees."
- "The farm unlocks everything."
- "Garran Hill is ready."
- "Sound that fills seventeen feet without effort."
- "The electrical capacity of a small hotel."
- "Fire going, no one home yet."
- "This room holds stories."

### What GPT-4o generates per photo
- room: exact space name
- quality_score: 1-10
- mood: a precise image, not adjectives
- best_use: hero / gallery / MLS / skip
- caption: one or two sentences, our voice, lands hard
- issues: specific technical problems or none
